        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
          What do you get when you combine the expertise of an individual who has been captivated by computers since the age of
          nine with someone with an innate curiosity about the intricacies of how and why things operate or work?
          Well, hi! I&#39;m Andrew Roide, and I've not only immersed myself in the world of computers for years but
          have also honed my skills as a Full Stack Developer.</p>
        <p>
          My ability to solve problems, maintain attention to detail, and willfulness to learn has advanced my ability to
          make clear, concise, and maintainable code. I&#39;m one to always learn by doing while also knowing when to ask the right questions.
          Whether it be collaborating as a valuable member of a team, or working independently on a project, I always infuse my pursuits with a
          dynamic blend of passion and proficiency. Being able to create, tinker, or solve problems, brings out my passion to attend to clients
          needs. Witnessing a client's satisfaction with their website brings me immense joy and further motivates my dedication to delivering exceptional results.

          From my childhood days spent unraveling riddles and solving Rubik&#39;s Cubes to tackling various puzzles in the gaming and real world,
          and even building computers and keyboards, these seemingly small interests have cumulatively shaped my entire life, aligning perfectly
          with the world of Web Development.
